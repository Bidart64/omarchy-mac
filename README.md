## Mirrorlist updates

Omarchy may provide a recommended `mirrorlist` during install, but it will not
silently overwrite an existing system mirrorlist. The installer and helper
scripts follow a safe default:

- If `/etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist` does not exist, Omarchy will install the
	bundled default.
- If it exists, Omarchy will merge `Server = ...` entries from the bundled
	mirrorlist into the existing file so user-configured or distribution-specific
	mirrors (e.g., Arch Linux ARM) are preserved.

If you want to force a full overwrite you can either run the helper with
`--force` and/or `--backup` to keep a timestamped backup, or set the
environment variable `OMARCHY_FORCE_MIRROR_OVERWRITE=1` during install.
